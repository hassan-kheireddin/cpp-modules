In Lebanon, the tech job market is smaller. Some ML/AI positions exist (often in multinationals or startups), but openings are far fewer and salaries much lower. For example, Glassdoor reports Machine Learning Engineers in Beirut earn only ~$2–3K per month
glassdoor.ie
 (i.e. ~$24–36K/year), reflecting the local economy. In practice, Lebanese candidates often seek remote AI roles for competitive pay, or focus on general software/data engineering with AI components. (Local postings on sites like Bayt.com do show occasional Data Engineer or ML roles, but these are limited compared to global demand.)

Average Salaries and Remote Opportunities

Globally, AI specialists command high pay. U.S. Machine Learning Engineers average ~$162.5K base salary

medium.com
lockedinai.com
. Experience with big-data tools (Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Airflow, etc.) is frequently requested for data-engineering or MLOps roles
medium.com
.

Cloud and DevOps: Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, or GCP) is critical
lockedinai.com
lockedinai.com
. LockedInAI notes that “AWS” appears in ~10% of top IT skill listings, and 90% of companies struggle to recruit cloud professionals (especially those who combine cloud and AI/automation skills)
lockedinai.com
lockedinai.com
. MLOps/DevOps tool experience (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, model deployment) is increasingly sought.

Mathematics & ML theory: Solid grounding in machine learning, statistics, and linear algebra is assumed for ML/AI roles
businessday.ng
. NLP roles specifically often require linguistics or semantic reasoning skills.

Emerging AI skills: Knowledge of LLMs and prompt engineering is quickly becoming valuable
dewintergroup.com
. For agentic AI and knowledge-based systems, familiarity with knowledge graphs, semantic layers, or AI agents is a new differentiator: industry analyses note growing demand for “knowledge engineers” who can build the semantic data architectures that drive AI agents

.

Soft skills: While technical, companies also value “human” skills in AI era: communication, problem-solving, creativity. Surveys find roles with high AI exposure increasingly ask for originality, problem-solving, and domain knowledge
zero100.com
.

In job postings, specific tool stacks often include AWS/Azure, Spark/Hadoop, SQL/NoSQL databases, Python ML libraries, and sometimes on-premise GPUs or TensorFlow/Torch. Summary: “Python + data” + cloud is the core combo, augmented by ML/AI frameworks and (for some roles) AI-ops tools or LLM tooling
medium.com
businessday.ng
.

Emerging Trends and Roles

Several new trends are reshaping AI careers:

Generative/Agentic AI: The explosive rise of generative AI has spawned new job categories. Posting for “generative AI” or “agentic AI” roles has jumped dramatically; one report notes generative AI openings outside core tech grew ~800% since 2022
lockedinai.com
. Consequently, roles like Prompt Engineer, LLM Engineer, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented) Specialist are emerging. Prompt Engineering is now seen as a specialized skill (a recent guide shows senior prompt engineers earning up to $200–270K
refontelearning.com
). Agentic AI (AI systems that autonomously act on complex tasks) is another focus: job posts mentioning “agentic AI” rose 2.5× since 2022, and hires for “knowledge engineers” and “semantic technology developers” have soared
zero100.com
. These roles involve building AI agent frameworks (knowledge graphs, automation pipelines, feedback loops).

AI/Automation Integration: Companies are blending AI with automation/RPA. Titles like AI Automation Engineer or AI Solutions Architect appear, focusing on end-to-end AI-driven workflows. For example, salary surveys list AI Automation Engineer positions paying from ~$80–110K (entry) up to ~$160–220K (senior)
refontelearning.com
. These roles require both ML skills and knowledge of automation platforms (e.g. UiPath, cloud pipelines).

Cloud-MLOps Specialization: As AI moves to the cloud, “Cloud AI Engineer” or “Machine Learning Ops Engineer” roles are growing. One industry study explicitly highlights “Cloud AI Engineer” among top new roles (listed with ~5,000 openings)
benefitnews.com
. These positions combine data science, software engineering, and cloud expertise (managing ML models on AWS/GCP, automating pipelines, ensuring scalability).

Industry-specific AI Experts: Sectors like finance, healthcare, and manufacturing seek AI-savvy staff. For example, AI Cybersecurity Engineer is rising (integrating AI with security), and AI Product Manager roles appear (bridging tech and business strategy)
dewintergroup.com
refontelearning.com
. IoT specialists and robotics engineers (per WEF listing) also now often require AI/ML know-how
businessday.ng
.

Overall, AI continues to create new hybrid roles. Reports stress that workers with AI skills command substantial premiums (one found a 56% wage premium on AI skills
pwc.com
) and that “skill change” in jobs is accelerating (skills in AI-exposed roles are changing 66% faster than in other jobs
pwc.com
). In practice, expect increasing demand for MLOps/cloud engineers, prompt/LLM engineers, agentic AI specialists, and data-oriented roles in the coming months.

Recommended Career Direction

For someone with strong programming foundations, basic AI understanding, and cloud/data exposure, the strategic path is to focus on roles that combine these strengths while aligning with trends. In particular:

Data/ML Engineer (with Cloud/MLOps focus): Data Engineers and ML Engineers are consistently top demand. Given your programming and data systems background, specializing further in data engineering (ETL, pipelines, data warehousing) and ML deployment is wise. Acquire skills in distributed data tools (Spark, Kafka), cloud data services (AWS/GCP data platforms), and MLOps (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD for ML). This “full-stack” profile (data+ML+cloud) is very marketable both locally and remotely
medium.com
lockedinai.com
. In practice, roles titled “Machine Learning Engineer” or “ML/Ops Engineer” would suit you: they demand Python, cloud, data and give the highest salaries (often $100–150K+)
datacamp.com
medium.com
.

Prompt/Generative AI Engineer: If you enjoy cutting-edge AI, upskilling in LLMs and prompt engineering can pay off. This is newer, but growth is rapid. A “Prompt Engineer” who knows how to build and tune generative models (e.g. using OpenAI/GPT, LangChain) can access six-figure roles
dewintergroup.com
refontelearning.com
. It pairs well with cloud knowledge (running LLMs on AWS/GCP) and programming skills. Consider portfolio projects using generative AI or courses on LLMOps to break into this niche.

AI Automation/Integration Roles: Given your cloud and data skills, roles like AI Solutions Architect or Cloud AI Engineer are also a fit. These positions blend software engineering, cloud, and AI (e.g. building AI-powered products or automating business workflows). They often require broad skillsets—programming, ML libraries, cloud architecture, and sometimes domain knowledge—but reward with high demand and flexibility.

Data Scientist (AI Applications): If you enjoy analytics and modeling, becoming a Data Scientist (with an AI focus) is another path. Enhance your statistical/ML skills, and learn how to leverage AI (e.g. using pretrained models, AutoML) for data insights. Data scientists remain in demand
dewintergroup.com
, though competition is higher. With cloud + coding background, you could quickly level up in ML/DL and data viz, making you stand out.

Key Upgrades: Whatever direction, emphasize Python proficiency, cloud certifications (AWS/GCP/Azure), and ML frameworks. Building a portfolio (e.g. Kaggle, open-source projects) in AI/ML will open remote opportunities. Also invest in “soft” AI skills: learn about prompt engineering, large language models, and (especially) the data architectures behind AI agents (knowledge graphs, semantic schemas)
zero100.com
. These emerging skills will make you competitive for next-wave roles.

In summary, Machine Learning/Data Engineering with cloud specialization is the safest strategic path (maximizing both local and remote prospects). Pair that with one of the hot new trends (e.g. generative AI or AI automation) to stand out. This blend of core programming + AI/data/cloud will align you with the highest-demand areas in 2024–25
